**O**utlier **D**etection for **M**acro-economic Times **S**eries

The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted the world economy, leading to abrupt changes in collected statistics. It raised the need for new appropriate methodologies to ensure the production of accurate indicators. In this paper, we propose a methodology of macro-economic time series outlier detection, robust to breaks and spikes. By applying unsupervised machine learning techniques, we explore novel ways of identifying abnormal observations in the broad sense, focusing on the dynamic of time series. Clustering algorithms, which aim to group series with similar dynamics, can reveal exogenous information and help us to better detect outliers to be investigated.
