**O**utlier **D**etection for **M**acro-economic Times **S**eries

The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted the world’s economy, leading to abrupt changes in the collected statistics. It raised the need for new appropriate methodologies to ensure the production of accurate indicators. In this paper, we propose an innovative methodology of macro-economic time series outlier detection. By applying unsupervised machine learning techniques, we explore novel ways of identifying abnormal observations in the broad sense, focusing on the series’ dynamic. Clustering algorithms, which aim to group series with similar dynamics, can reveal exogenous information and help us to better detect outliers to be investigated. 

The paper was published through the BIS IFC workshop on "Data Science in Central Banking" and is available here (*link to edit*).

The project will be soon installable as a package.
